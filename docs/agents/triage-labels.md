# Triage labels

The engineering skills use five canonical triage roles. Their local Markdown status values are:

| Canonical role | Local status | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `needs-triage` | `needs-triage` | Maintainer must evaluate the issue |
| `needs-info` | `needs-info` | Waiting for more information |
| `ready-for-agent` | `ready-for-agent` | Fully specified and ready for an agent |
| `ready-for-human` | `ready-for-human` | Requires human implementation |
| `wontfix` | `wontfix` | Will not be actioned |

When a skill refers to a canonical triage role, use the corresponding value as the issue file's `Status:`.
